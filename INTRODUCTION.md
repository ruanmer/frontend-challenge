# Introduction

This README explains the motivations behind each decision I made.

## Before starting coding

First, I updated the project's dependencies to ensure all dependencies were up to date and prevent bugs or security issues that were fixed.

To ensure code quality and improve the workflow, I installed several tools, such as:

- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) to enforce a consistent code style.
- [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) to ensure code quality and consistency.
- [Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) to lint commits and ensure Conventional Commits rules.
- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [Lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) to execute commands before a commit is made.
- [Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook) to make building UI components easier.
